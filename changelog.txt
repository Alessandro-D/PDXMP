BALANCE
- Uncivilized nations mine less efficiently
	- 50% less efficiency and smaller mines
- Iron rgo boosts from PDXMP mod reworked, now more effective
	- increased throughput for flat iron production bonus
- Removed bad RGO changes from HPM
- Constitutional Monarchies cannot change parties without elections
- NF for boosting party loyalty increased (0.03 to 0.10) (pdxmp balance mod used 0.08)
- Healthcare and School reforms will increase pension level

	- these advanced levels also require higher spending than before
- Neglecting social spending now has negative triggered modifier
	- Small pop decline, lowered education, and negative ruling party support
- Trade policies changed: no more 100% tariffs
	- 50% max from protectionism, 25% max from free trade, trade laws still raise these up or down slightly
- AI has triggered modifier buff, slight bonuses for various modifiers
	- small bonuses for research, education, 10% higher minimum tax/tariff, more efficient taxes/tariffs
- Education triggered modifiers to curve literacy growth rate
	- starting with 50% literacy every 10% literacy gives -10% education efficiency, ie -30% at 70% literacy
	- after 90% literacy there are 2 more levels to slow down 100% literacy
- Intellectuals raise literacy slightly less
	- intellectuals needed for max literacy growth raised from 4% to 6%
- Intellectual NF cannot be used past 3% intellectuals
- Intellectuals harder to promote in non-states
- Biologism nerfed, 50% boost down to 10%
- Research point allocation changed: less from intellectuals, more from clerks
- New triggered modifiers for urbanization: based on % of craftsmen/clerks
	- low urbanisation can be achieved with 20% artisans, so city states like hamburg start with it
- Higher urbanization increases input efficiency, slightly raises research
- Research bonus from british raj and dutch indonesia lowered: no longer flat +1.0, now % modifier
- Prussian General Staff reworked: split into 2 different modifiers
- More dig in bonus from certain defensive techs
- Engineers have more support and defense from techs
- Guards, cavalry, tanks have higher discipline

	- replaced with country wide growth or province life rating adjustments
- Fixed EIC events
- Capitalists daily needs massively reduced, now will have money leftover to invest after buying their daily 20 automobiles
- Liberal economies are viable
	- liberal policies buffed, better input efficiency and reduced import costs for free trade
